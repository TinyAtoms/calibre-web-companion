# how to use:
EDIT `./CalibreWebCompanion/settings.json.bak`
Remove the `.bak` from `db.sqlite3.bak` and `settings.json.bak`
`./CalibreWebCompanion`    
run `./manage.py runserver`  

this is in development mode. don't actually use it or release it like this. The debug info it shows is spicy.  
The instructions mentioned above are for running this in debug mode, not to deploy the project, and this will be ammended in the future.
